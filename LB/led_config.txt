LED Specifications:

1. Deep Red (660 nm): Efficiency = 2.5 µmol/J
2. Dual-Peak Blue (430 + 480 nm): Efficiency = 1.8 µmol/J
3. Blue (450 nm): Efficiency = 2.0 µmol/J
4. Cool White (450 + 550 nm): Efficiency = 1.5 µmol/J
(Efficiencies based on mid-range LEDs)

Power per LED: 0.5W (to reach 10W total with 20 LEDs).

Photon Flux (µmol/s) per LED:
1. Deep Red: 2.5 µmol/J × 0.5 W = 1.25 µmol/s
2. Dual-Peak Blue: 1.8 µmol/J × 0.5 W = 0.9 µmol/s
3. Blue (450 nm): 2.0 µmol/J × 0.5 W = 1.0 µmol/s
4. Cool White: 1.5 µmol/J × 0.5 W = 0.75 µmol/s
